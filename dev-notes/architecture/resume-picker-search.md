# `/resume` picker searchbar

## What changed

The `/resume` modal (`SessionPickerScreen` in `src/tau_coding/tui/app.py`) now
has a search field, matching the existing search UX in the model picker
(`ModelPickerScreen`) and the login provider picker
(`LoginProviderPickerScreen`).

- Opening `/resume` (or pressing `Ctrl+R`) focuses a new
  `#session-picker-search` input above the session list.
- Typing filters the visible sessions by title, model, or working directory
  (case-insensitive substring match), live as you type.
- Arrow keys, Enter, and Escape keep working the same way, whether focus is on
  the search field or the list — the search input forwards those keys to the
  picker screen instead of editing its own text.
- Submitting the search field (Enter) selects the currently highlighted
  session, same as pressing Enter with the list focused.
- When no sessions match, the help line switches to "No matching sessions -
  Escape closes".

## Why it exists

Session lists grow over time, and finding a specific past session by scrolling
through an unfiltered list becomes tedious. This brings `/resume` in line with
the model and login pickers, which already offer this pattern.

## How it maps to existing pickers

The new `SessionPickerSearchInput` and the refresh/filter logic in
`SessionPickerScreen` mirror `ModelPickerSearchInput` /
`_filter_model_choices` and `LoginProviderSearchInput` /
`_filter_login_providers`:

- A dedicated `Input` subclass keeps navigation keys (`up`, `down`, `escape`)
  local to the picker instead of letting the `Input` widget consume them.
- A `_filter_session_records` module-level helper computes the visible
  records from the full record list and the current search text.
- `_refresh_session_list` rebuilds the `ListView` children and the help text
  whenever the search text or record set changes.

No changes were needed to `tau_agent` or `tau_ai` — this is purely a
`tau_coding` TUI/frontend change, consistent with keeping the reusable agent
harness free of Textual-specific code.

## Testing

- `test_tui_app_session_picker_search_filters_sessions` — typing a query
  narrows the list and Enter still resumes the highlighted (filtered) session.
- `test_tui_app_session_picker_search_with_no_matches_shows_help_text` —
  typing a query with no matches empties the list and updates the help text.
- Existing `/resume` picker tests (arrow-key navigation, Enter-to-resume,
  human-readable metadata) continue to pass unchanged.

## Manual verification

1. Create a few sessions with different titles/models (or resume real
   history) so `/resume` has more than one row.
2. Run `tau`, then press `Ctrl+R` (or type `/resume` and press Enter).
3. Confirm the search field is focused and type part of a session title or
   model name — the list should narrow live.
4. Press Enter to resume the highlighted session.
5. Try a query that matches nothing and confirm the help text changes to
   "No matching sessions - Escape closes".
6. Press Escape at any point to confirm the picker still closes without
   resuming.
