title: Skills & prompt templates
description: Teach Tau reusable know-how with skills, and stop retyping instructions with prompt templates.
---

Tau loads two kinds of reusable Markdown from disk: **skills** (how to do a
task) and **prompt templates** (a saved prompt you trigger by name). Both can
live at the user level (available everywhere) or inside a project.

## Where the files go

Skills are loaded from these locations, in increasing precedence (later
overrides earlier on name clashes):

```text
Tau's bundled first-party skills
~/.tau/skills/
~/.agents/skills/
~/.agents/
<cwd>/.tau/skills/
<cwd>/.agents/skills/
<cwd>/.agents/
```

Prompt templates load from:

```text
~/.tau/prompts/
~/.agents/prompts/
<cwd>/.tau/prompts/
<cwd>/.agents/prompts/
```

After adding or editing files while the TUI is open, run **`/reload`** to
rediscover them. Duplicate/overridden resources are reported as diagnostics, not
fatal errors.

## Skills

A skill is a directory containing a `SKILL.md` file, following the
[Agent Skills spec](https://agentskills.io/specification#directory-structure).
The directory name is the skill name. Optional frontmatter gives it a
description:

```text
~/.tau/skills/security-review/SKILL.md
```

```md
---
description: Review a diff for security issues.
---

Steps to review the current diff for security problems...
```

Any supporting files (references, snippets) can live alongside `SKILL.md`
inside the same directory.

{{% tip %}}
Bare `.md` files at the root of a skills directory (for example
`~/.tau/skills/review.md`) are **not** loaded as skills. Tau will surface a
diagnostic telling you to move them into their own directory:

```bash
cd ~/.tau/skills
mkdir review && mv review.md review/SKILL.md
```

This matches the Agent Skills spec and applies uniformly across `.tau/` and
`.agents/` locations.

Tau ships with first-party `create-tau-extension` and `tau-model-catalog`
skills so installed copies know the supported workflows for extending Tau and
maintaining its built-in provider catalog. Define a user or project skill with
the same name to override the bundled workflow.

Tau lists loaded skills in the system prompt so the model knows they exist and
can read the full file (via the `read` tool) when relevant. Invoke one
explicitly:

```text
/skill:security-review check the changes on this branch
```

`/skill:<name>` is a *prompt-expansion* path — Tau expands the skill into your
prompt and runs it as a normal turn.

## Prompt templates

A prompt template is a saved prompt you trigger by its filename. For example
`~/.agents/prompts/wt.md` becomes the prompt `wt`. Templates can include
variables with `{{ name }}`:

```md
---
description: Implement a feature in an isolated git worktree.
---

Implement this feature safely in a new worktree:
{{ feature }}
```

If a template has no placeholders, your arguments are appended after a blank
line. Variables are filled from the arguments you pass when invoking it.

## Skill vs. prompt template — which?

- Use a **prompt template** when you keep typing the *same instructions* and
  just want a shortcut (with optional fill-in variables).
- Use a **skill** when you want to give the model *reference know-how* it can
  pull in when a task calls for it, invoked with `/skill:<name>`.

Keep personal, cross-project helpers in `~/.agents/`. Keep project-specific ones
in the repo's `.tau/` or `.agents/` so they're shared with collaborators.
